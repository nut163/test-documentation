# Serverless Webpages with JavaScript

Serverless architecture allows you to build and run applications without thinking about servers. In the context of web development, a serverless webpage is one that doesn't rely on a dedicated backend server for its functionality. Instead, it leverages various services to perform server-side tasks, such as database operations, user authentication, etc.

Here's a simple example of how you can use JavaScript to fetch data from a serverless function.

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/my-serverless-function')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

In this example, `https://api.example.com/my-serverless-function` is the URL of your serverless function. When called, this function could perform any server-side task (like fetching data from a database) and return the result.

Remember, the actual implementation of the serverless function is not within the scope of your webpage's JavaScript code. It could be a AWS Lambda function, a Google Cloud Function, or any other serverless computing service.

In the next sections, we will dive deeper into how you can use JavaScript to interact with serverless functions and create dynamic, serverless webpages. For more examples, please refer to the `serverless_example.js` file in the `examples` directory.
